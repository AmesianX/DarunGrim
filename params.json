{"name":"Darungrim","tagline":"A Binary Diffing and Patch Analysis Tool ","body":"### What is DarunGrim?\r\n\r\nDarunGrim is a binary diffing tool. DarunGrim is a free diffing tool which provides binary diffing functionality.\r\nBinary diffing is a powerful technique to reverse-engineer patches released by software vendors like Microsoft. Especially by analyzing security patches you can dig into the details of the vulnerabilities it's fixing. You can use that information to learn what causes software break. Also that information can help you write some protection codes for those specific vulnerabilities. It's also used to write 1-day exploits by malware writers or security researchers.\r\nThis binary diffing technique is especially useful for Microsoft binaries. Not like other vendors they are releasing patch regularly and the patched vulnerabilities are relatively concentrated in small areas in the code. That makes the patched part more visible and apparent to the patch analyzers.\r\n\r\n### DarunGrim 4\r\nDarunGrim 4 is an advanced version of DarunGrim2 and 3 which provides nice file management UI.\r\nBinaries: DarunGrim.zip\r\nSource: http://github.com/ohjeongwook/DarunGrim\r\nLicense: New BSD License\r\nBlogs: http://mattoh.wordpress.com/ ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
